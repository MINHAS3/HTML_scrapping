# HTML_scrapping

This weeks module on HTML had many challenges in creating the web page and scraping data, the challenege that I had was scraping the data. 
During the install of the extensions I was able to install all of them however when I was working with getting the code setup I received "error" messages. 
I sought the advice of the TA and classmates to assist me in getting the code to work.
